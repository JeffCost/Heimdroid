Android app for heimcontrol.js

On your heimcontrol Server, check out this branch: `https://github.com/JorisM/heimcontrol.js/tree/feature/api`

Download and install app, point your settings url to your Heimcontroljs Server and you are good to go.

Note: I had to enable port 8080 or whatever on my local firewall, otherwise requests didn't go through. If you have your Server listening on port 80, you can
don't need to specifiy the port. (i.e `http://heimcontrol:80/` --> `http://heimcontrol/`)
